# Zenith Devlog 6/20/24

Writing schedule? Pssst. Never heard of it.

I've put a ton of time into Zenith the past few weeks, and I'm starting to think a playable, mildly enjoyable beta is not that far away.

# Small Games Manifesto

Awhile back I read an article, [Making Small Games, Which Is Fun in Itself](https://abagames.github.io/joys-of-small-game-development-en/fun_to_make_small_games.html#fn_5) by ABA games. At the time I enjoyed the thesis: small games let you experiment more, and are a great way to make things you're proud of without suffering through a months-long epic and losing motivation. As I've been working on a bunch of loose ends for Zenith (menu-ing, overworlds, smooth background transitions, bugs, ...) I've found another benefit of learning to love small games: really good big games are just a bunch of small games.

In traditional "Computer Science" (whatever that means) uniform abstraction is the gold standard. Whether it be for an assignment, or a job, or even a hobby project, code that cleanly takes advantage of every possible redundancy in the problem space is praised. Well-engineered apps really are like legos. Every problem can be solved by neatly sticking together a few pieces and testing the shit out it. If there's a problem that can't be lego-ified, it means you need to redesign your legos.

I think when I started making games, I took this philosophy with me. Honestly, this is part of the reason I find UI-based editors like Unity frustrating: it seems like their actively discouraging you from finding logical abstraction. They're hiding the "fun part". But now that I'm seriously tasked with taking something which can kind-of-sort-of make and play little levels to a fully-featured game, I understand why this is probably a good thing.

Because a lot of things that make a game feel great are messy. Really messy. Some may even call them Spaghetti. How do you create an overworld without adding some heinous back-door if statements to update progress correctly? Can you make the settings page, or the pause menu, or dialog boxes in a way that feels like "clean" reuse of the core legos? I don't think so.[^1] Or at the very least, it's better to spend a day on it and have it feel a little spaghetti than spend a week building a library to convince yourself it's "clean".

This is where the small-games mindset ends up being really helpful. These tedious tasks become less tedious. Making a good overworld goes from being a chore to another opportunity to make something special. Sure, it's good to reuse stuff if you can, but if you want to make something that feels unique, it might be easier to just treat it as it's own game.

### Example: Menus

Most players today expect games to have smooth menus. But what is a menu, really? I contend it's its own kind of game. The inputs are simple. The state space is simple. But if should _feel_ enjoyable. Animations, sound effects, screen effects. It needs all of these, and sure you can reuse some of the logic from the main game, but really not that much.

## Revamping the Menu

The previous menu I'd made was a glorified splash screen. No ability to accept meaningful user input. Hardcoded transitions that would fail seemingly randomly. It was a mess.

I basically ripped the whole thing out and started over. My favorite part of the old menu (which I kept) was the parallax background. The game I settled on for the menu was a simple two-button scroller. Press enter to go forward, escape to go back. The stars should move and twinkle based on what you've got selected. Easy and fun!

### The Overworld

I also took a crack at an overworld, which was a ton of fun. Thinking back to some of my favorite games (Super Mario Galaxy being a great example) a memorable overworld can really change the way you interract with a game. It's nice to step out of a level and have something that feels complete.

I didn't build anything crazy, just a nice way to show the various "galaxies" (collections of levels) and some animations to show a little ship flying between them.

# Sounds

I also finally tackled sounds and music this week. Honestly, sounds and music are things I always take for granted in polished games. I can't remember the last time I played a game that didn't have (at least mostly) incredible music. And sound effects — when done right — feel expected. Not like a benefit.

Adding this ended up being a lot easier than I thought. Bevy doesn't seem to have great support for Audio (yet), but my use case is pretty simple. Spawn a thing which is always playing the background music, add a system to watch it, and a resource to control it. For sound effects, I settled on two kinds: "spatial" and "universal" (non-spatial). Spatial effects have a Transform, and change in volume based on where the camera is. Universal effects play at the same volume no matter what.

_____________

[^1]: I'll admit that this probably isn't _impossible_. One of my favorite games of all time, "Baba is You", has an overworld that I'd bet is at least 95% "core" game code. This is probably an exception, however, as the core of "Baba is You" _is_ heinous if statements.
