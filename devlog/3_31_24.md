# Zenith Devlog 3/31/24

I've noodled around on a lot of games. Some in more established engines (Unity, Unreal), others from scratch (C++). Recently, I've been playing around with Bevy, an insanely powerful but light-weight engine that feels like scratch but gets rid of a lot of the annoying stuff. Also, it's in rust, which is (imo) a joy to program in.

Most of the time, I get really into these games for a few weeks, but then completely drop them. Either the gameplay doesn't feel good, or I'm not passionate about the story, or I'm simply afraid of how much work it'll be.

But with my current game, _Zenith_, things feel different. I've got a concrete sense of what the gameplay will be like, and it _feels_ good. I like the story, and I think I just might have a solid enough grasp on Bevy/ECS in general where I can make things happen in the game relatively quickly.

Also, I'm in a pretty unique place in my life at the moment. I'm about to graduate college, and have decided to go out with a relatively light semester. This might be the last time in awhile I can afford to make some passion-game a major priority, and I don't want to waste the opportunity.

So, I've decided to start a devlog. In this post, I hope to explain _why_ I'm doing this, _who_ I think might be interested, and actually write my first devlog. 

## Why a devlog?

Plainly speaking: I want to finish this game, I want it to be good, and I want to be polished. I think getting fragments of the game and my mind out in to the public as early as possible will be motivating and make the final product as high quality as possible.

I've also spent a lot of time working with Bevy, and want to get more involved in the community. I'm hoping that by putting my thoughts, struggles, and solutions out in the open I can engage with the community, providing and receiving valuable advice.

Also, forcing myself to sit down and write at a high-level about the project every week will make it easier to stay on track, and continue to work on the highest priority tasks (not just whatever seems fun in the moment).

## Who cares?

Realistically, probably no one. I'm perfectly content if this ends up being loose rambling into the void.

But for the sake of focusing my writing, here's who I'm thinking might want to read some of these:

- People who care about me / my work - My future self, friends, other game developers.
- People who want to learn more about Bevy/Rust - I anticipate being pretty technical in these posts. I'm hoping I can answer someone's random Google search (Bevy docs are not great), and hopefully even get roasted by someone who's smarter than me.
- People who want to play the game - This will probably be 0 people for a long time. But maybe once I get a public beta I can use this as a space to get feedback from potential players about what they want to see from the game.
